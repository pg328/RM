# RM Interview

This is the repository that both the database (via Prisma Schema) lives, and the web app run through. I've included a few sketches in the <code>public</code> directory.

## This is private!

I know, I've just put this public for the few hours surrounding the interview, I'll take it back down at the end of the day, or earlier if you ask me to before then!

## Decisions

This is where I'll be documenting the reasoning behind the decisions that I've made, and the technologies that I've chosen.

## Design

As I mentioned above, I've included some early sketches of how I envisioned the application to work, and I've included them in the public directory so they'll also be accessible through the site!

## How is this deployed?

I like to use Vercel, and I have an account with Railway.app, so for proof of concept I have free deployment of this site, and it should be usable in real time, so feel free to have a play around while I talk you through it!
